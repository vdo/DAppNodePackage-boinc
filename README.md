# DAppNodePackage-boinc

This package runs a BOINC client in your DAppNode, so you can use your spare CPU resources to help research on various scientific projects.

## How to use this package

### Register an account in a project

You can find a list of projects [here](https://boinc.berkeley.edu/projects.php). I will be using Rossetta as an example.
For Rosetta, you can create an account [here](https://boinc.bakerlab.org/rosetta/create_account_form.php)

### Get your project key

Once logged in, you can copy your project key (look for Weak account key) from [here](https://boinc.bakerlab.org/rosetta/weak_auth.php).

### Start BOINC

Install and start BOINC in dappnode with the link: 
http://my.dappnode/#/installer/boinc.public.dappnode.eth

## Bonus: earning OByte crypto for your contribution (World Community Grid members only)

You can also can get a small daily payout if you link your [World Community Grid](https://worldcommunitygrid.org) account to OByte address. Current payout rate is set at $1.00 (in Bytes) for every 150,000 points. In addition, all your previous contribution stats will be saved in blockchain (as "WCG points" asset) and updated daily.

Also keep in mind that World Community Grid uses modified BOINC server and have a [different point calculation rate](https://www.worldcommunitygrid.org/help/viewTopic.do?shortName=points#177) (TL;DR: 7 WCG points = 1 "standard" BOINC point).
